# Frontend Testing Workshop

### Requirements:

1. Banner that says 'Please enter your name'
2. User input for name
3. Submit button changes banner to 'Welcome, <name>!'
4. User input only accepts letters and spaces
5. Displays warning if input is invalid

### Instructions:

#### `validateInput`

1. Test that it returns true with a string input
2. Create `validateInput` function, return `true`
3. Test that it returns false with a number input
4. Update function to check isNaN
5. Test edge cases
6. Update function with regex

#### `UserInput`

1. Write a test that it displays warning text on invalid input and vice versa
2. Create component, make test pass

#### `UserInputContainer`

1. Test that default text is 'Hello, you!'
2. Create component, make it pass
3. Test that display text changes on submit
4. Make test pass
5. Integration test: warning on invalid input, button is disabled

---

### Notes:

- Isolate tests - use UserInputContainer as stateful example
- Notice what we're intentionally not testing:
  - `state` and class methods (internals)
  - `className`s - (not a functional concern)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
